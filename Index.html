          <h3>What Does it Mean to Collect Cards?</h3>
          <p>The concept of collecting trading cards can vary from one person to another, a general concept can be described as the act of collecting cards towards a personal collection. Almost every card game can be collected for one&apos:s personal interest, one prime example being baseball trading cards. Some cards are either solely for trade and collection or can be used for play, with card games such as <i>Pok&eacute;mon</i> and <i>Yu&ndash;Gi&ndash;Oh&excl;</i></p>

          <p><img src="images/early_trading_card.png" alt="EarlyCard" class="flowRight" width="380" height="218" border="6">Trading cards were started aroud the late 1800s as a means of advertisement, such as for Coca&ndash;Cola promotions. This introducion of marketing promotion was to entice its customers, or attarct new ones, towards product consumption, as the card was decorated with a bright image accompanied by the logo of the company and a company image. Also around the 1860s baseball became a popular sport in the Americas, and soon after baseball cards were printed. During those years collecting cards became popular for its time and subsided a bit near the 1900s.</p>
          <p><img src="images/1980-Topps-Dave-Stieb.jpg" alt="Baseball Card" class="flowLeft" width="300" height="409" border="6">When baseball cards were being printed, they were usually included with bubble gum. Along with the commerical use of cards the companies that focused on baseball products then made the cards more appealing, by adding the image of the players and then a small biography on the back of the card. In the 1950s, Tops Chewing Gum Inc. produced these cards along with their products and eventually printed the cards alone in packs of bundles. In the 1980s the value of collecting cards grew and companies printed more to meet demand, but had a backlash as the value of the cards became worthless due to overprinting. They then regulated the volume of what cards are printed to produce a sense of scarcity, giving the cards value for their time, but unbeknowingly, for the future.</p>

          <h3>Expanding from Baseball Cards</h3>
          <p>Approaching the 2000s the hobby of collecting took a new turn as the cards people would collect would be introduced into playability as a game. This gave birth the Trading Card Game, starting with <i>Magic: The Gathering</i>, a turn based game where two players fight eachother using the resources from their cards, known as a deck, as well as their knowledge of their cards and interactions each card gives when played. This introduced card playability along with the concept of collectibiliy as <i>Magic: The Gathering</i> includes card rarities and limited edition printings.</p>
          <p>Along with Magic, more trading card games were created in the 90s and the years later on, such as <i>Pok&eacute;mon</i>, <i>Yu&ndash;Gi&ndash;Oh&excl;</i>, <i>Game of Thrones: The Card Game</i>, <i>Digimon Card Game</i>, <i>Keyforge</i>, and many more. These new cards and card games entering the genre of a collecting made the hobby a thriving past time for those who have interest in the hobby.</p>
